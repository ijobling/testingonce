====================================

At this point you have learned about Python’s core data structures, and you have seen some of the algorithms that use them. If you would like to know more about algorithms, this might be a good time to read Chapter [algorithms]. But you don’t have to read it before you go on; you can read it whenever you are interested.

This chapter presents a case study with exercises that let you think about choosing data structures and practice using them.
