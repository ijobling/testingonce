###
This problem is most common when your file consists of functions and classes but does not actually invoke a function to start execution. This may be intentional if you only plan to import this module to supply classes and functions.

If it is not intentional, make sure there is a function call in the program, and make sure the flow of execution reaches it (see “Flow of Execution” below).
