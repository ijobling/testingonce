============================

This chapter presents a case study that demonstrates a process for designing functions that work together.

It introduces the <span>turtle</span> module, which allows you to create images using turtle graphics. The <span>turtle</span> module is included in most Python installations, but if you are running Python using PythonAnywhere, you won’t be able to run the turtle examples (at least you couldn’t when I wrote this).

If you have already installed Python on your computer, you should be able to run the examples. Otherwise, now is a good time to install. I have posted instructions at <http://tinyurl.com/thinkpython2e>.

Code examples from this chapter are available from <http://thinkpython2.com/code/polygon.py>.
