Most of the time, infinite recursion causes the program to run for a while and then produce a <span>Maximum recursion depth exceeded</span> error.

If you suspect that a function is causing an infinite recursion, make sure that there is a base case. There should be some condition that causes the function to return without making a recursive invocation. If not, you need to rethink the algorithm and identify a base case.

If there is a base case but the program doesnâ€™t seem to be reaching it, add a <span>print</span> statement at the beginning of the function that prints the parameters. Now when you run the program, you will see a few lines of output every time the function is invoked, and you will see the parameter values. If the parameters are not moving toward the base case, you will get some ideas about why not.
